This is an illustration of star schema data model on an imaginary data warehouse for interview task at EPAM:

1. Considering the star schema model of DB with three tables: "Product", "Category", "Sales"
  - Add at least one more dimension to the model
  - Add Business Keys (Natural keys) to your dimensions
  - Include the new dimension in the fact table as well
2. Create a free account on any git provider â€“ i.e. git hub, unless you already have
3. Choose some database in order to execute your scripts, i.e. SQL Server
4. Create DDL scripts that implement your data model and add them to git
5. Create DML scripts that populate your model with some test data and add them to git
6. Create a simple stored procedure, that would check if there are any duplicates in the PRODUCT table and delete them if occur. Add to git as well
7. Prepare a simple Power BI dashboard that would present some analytics about your data
